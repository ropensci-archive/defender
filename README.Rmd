# defender <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/ropenscilabs/defender.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ropenscilabs/defender)
[![Coverage status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ropenscilabs/defender/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/ropenscilabs/defender?branch=master)

The goal of defender is to do static code analysis on other R packages to check for potential security risks and best practices. It provides checks on multiple levels:

1. [x] static code analysis without installing the package
2. [ ] more thorough but potentially dangerous checks with installation / in Docker container

The checks do not tell you whether something is harmful but rather they flag code that you should double-check before running / loading the package.

## Installation

You can install defender from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/defender")
```

## Example

You can check for system calls in any directory locally available:

```{r system-calls-example}
defender::summarize_system_calls("../testevil")
```

You can also include additional elements to flag as dangerous:

```{r system-calls-example-2}
sc <- defender::system_calls("poll")
defender::summarize_system_calls("../testevil", calls_to_flag = sc)
```

You can check the NAMESPACE file in a package for dangerous imports:

```{r namespace-example}
defender::check_namespace("../testevil")
```
You can also include additional elements to flag as dangerous:

```{r namespace-example-2}
di <- defender::dangerous_imports("processx::poll")
defender::check_namespace("../testevil", imports_to_flag = di)
```
